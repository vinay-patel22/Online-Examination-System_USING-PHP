# Online-Examination-System_USING-PHP

This is a README file for the Online Examination System project, developed using PHP. It is my first project in PHP, created as part of my academic studies.



Project Overview
The Online Examination System is a web-based application designed to conduct online exams. It provides a platform for students to take exams remotely and for instructors to manage and evaluate the exams. The system offers various features such as user authentication, exam creation, exam scheduling, and result management.
